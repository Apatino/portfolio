    <h3>Testing and Therefore Users are Essential to Design Thinking</h3>
    <p>I was asked to suggest at least two changes for <a href="http://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a> website, and I wanted to follow the data-driven approach, booking as a company follows, of course using the resources and time at hand. The way this data-driven thinking can also be interpreted, it's to think that you should always try to resist the temptation of making decisions trusting in your mere intuition. <br/> Because of this, I wanted to conduct a short quantitative research, this in hopes to detect any pain points and suggest improvements to ease user's experience in the site which potentially will affect positively the company's macro goal, in this case, a higher number bookings.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of the Participants</h3>
    <p>When looking for participants I wanted to focus on behaviors rather than demographics. The test was made with one woman and two men, they’re between 33 and 23 years old, middle to high income and all three of them Colombian. 
This might seem relevant to the test but what I tried to find in the participants was behaviors and characteristics that matched the potential booking.com customer. With this I refer that for example, they have booked flights and hotel rooms online in the past, they all travel out of the country at least once a year, they are used to online transactions in the daily basis and because of this, they are likely to use the website in the future.</p>

    <h3>A Few Things to Keep in Mind</h3>
    <p>Because the videos are in Spanish, I list here the overall indications given to the users so you can have a better context of what's happening:</p>
    <ul class="text-list">
      <li class="text-list-item"><p>Try to imagine you're alone in the room, but you can ask any question that you feel is blocking you from continuing with the test.</p></li>
      <li class="text-list-item"><p>There are not wrong or right answers; we're testing the software, not you.</p></li>
      <li class="text-list-item"><p>Speak your mind, verbalize your thoughts so we can understand the way and what you're thinking.</p></li>
      <li class="text-list-item"><p>Be as candid as possible, I was not involved in the design of this software and I won't be offended by what you say.</p></li>
      <li class="text-list-item"><p>Lastly I tried to explain to the user what the recording software (<a href="https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a>) is for, what it does and how the recording will be used.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Task Given</h3>
    <p>For the purpose of the exercise, the users were asked to assume they were going in a trip to Medellín, between July 16th and 25th. They were asked to book an hotel for these nights, their budget per night it's a maximum of 150.000 Colombian pesos, and they should choose the said hotel with the criteria they usually use. <br/>Because they've never used the website in the past, they should start the session from scratch creating an account in the process.</p>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>I wanted to find patterns in all three different cases but because of the reduced number of tests I would like to focus only in three things, I consider, are problems. In the video, users, talk about couple of other things but I believe the narrower we focus the efforts the better results. This is also why I wanted to explore a small part of the website.</p>
    
      <h4>First  Problem</h4>
      <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

      <h4>Second  Problem</h4>
      <p>Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination. Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another. Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. <br/>The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
